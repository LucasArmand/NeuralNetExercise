# Neural Network for Language Translation and Image Recognition
This is a project I worked on during my AP Computer Science class. I wanted to improve my understanding of the inner workings of machine learning, and I felt that the best
way to do that would be to build my own implementation of the forward and backward pass in Java. While obviously not a practical approach for high speed training/inference
or for large datasets, this exercise solidified my understanding of the fundamentals of machine learning.

## Function
In this exercise, I implemented a language translation using a very small dataset of English and Italian words. The words were encoded as vectors of characters, where each letter was a unique number. This proved not to be a very effective way to encode words, as my testing showed.

I also implemented a convolutional architecture for image recognition, as well as a WebScraper for collecting stock market data. My plan was to try and build some kind of stock market prediction machine learning model, but I never collected enough data for any kind of accuracy outside of the training set.
